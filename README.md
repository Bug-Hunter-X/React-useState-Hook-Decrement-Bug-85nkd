# React useState Hook Decrement Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `useState` hook in React to manage a counter. The counter behaves unexpectedly when decrementing, particularly when the count reaches zero. The problem and its solution are presented in separate JavaScript files.

**bug.js**: Contains the buggy implementation of the counter component.

**bugSolution.js**: Provides the corrected implementation to fix the decrement behavior.

This example highlights the importance of understanding how state updates are handled in React and the potential pitfalls of conditional logic within state update functions.

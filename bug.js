This React component utilizes the `useState` hook to manage a count.  Incrementing the count works correctly; however, decrementing it leads to unexpected behavior, specifically, it will only decrement once or not at all. The issue lies within the conditional statement governing the decrement operation, and the way `setCount` interacts with the conditional check. When the count reaches 0, the decrement function does not correctly update the state.
